//! SteelSeries GameSenseâ„¢ client written in Rust
//!
//!
//! To use this crate, simply add it as a dependency:
//! ```toml
//! [dependency]
//! gamesense = "0.1.2"
//! ```
//!
//!
//! To get started, simply instantiate your client using the
//! [`gamesense::client::GameSenseClient`][client::GameSenseClient] struct. ```
//! let mut client = GameSenseClient::new("GAME_ID", "Game Display Name",
//! "Author", None)?; ```
//!
//! In this example, a client is created to the local API and it automatically
//! creates a game with the provided values. Each value deemed optional by the
//! official documentation can receive `None` as a value to default it to the
//! server's default. If you wish to have a raw client for the API, you can!
//! Simply use the
//! [`gamesense::raw_client::RawGameSenseClient`][raw_client::
//! RawGameSenseClient]
//!
//! For more (in-depth) examples refer to the [examples](https://github.com/ptrstr/gamesense/tree/master/examples)
//!
//! For information regarding the API see the [original API documentation](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk)
